                        <p>Early Childhood Education (ECE) focuses on the development, care, and education of children from birth to around 8 years old. This field involves creating safe, nurturing, and stimulating environments where young children can learn and grow. In Australia, ECE is a high-demand field, with opportunities in childcare centers, preschools, kindergartens, and primary schools.</p>
